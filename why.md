# Why

## Introduction

The idea of "The Black List" is to give the interested tourist a guide of the cultural and socio-economic experiences of black people in the United-States and aboard.

Although this curated list attempts to be a comprehensive source, we don't know everything. If you know of some sources we have missed that would greatly benefit others, please contribute for your fellow tourists.
